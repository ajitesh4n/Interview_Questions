IActionResult in ASP.NET Core is an interface that represents the result of an action method in a controller. It allows you to return different types of responses (like views, JSON, status codes, or redirects) in a unified way, making your controller methods flexible and consistent.

🌐 What is IActionResult?
Definition: IActionResult is part of the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc namespace. It defines a contract for action results that a controller action can return.
Purpose: It abstracts the response so you can return various result types (e.g., Ok(), NotFound(), Redirect(), View()) without tying your method to a specific return type.
Why Use IActionResult?
Flexibility: You can return different responses depending on conditions. For example:

csharp
public IActionResult GetProduct(int id)
{
    var product = _context.Products.Find(id);
    if (product == null)
        return NotFound();
    return Ok(product);
}
Consistency: Keeps controller methods uniform, especially in APIs where you may need to return success, error, or redirect responses.

Extensibility: You can create custom action results by implementing IActionResult.

🔑 Common Implementations of IActionResult
OkResult → Returns HTTP 200 (success).

NotFoundResult → Returns HTTP 404 (resource not found).

BadRequestResult → Returns HTTP 400 (invalid request).

RedirectResult → Redirects to another URL.

ViewResult → Returns a Razor view in MVC.

JsonResult → Returns JSON data.

IActionResult vs ActionResult<T>
IActionResult: Non-generic, can return any type of result.

ActionResult<T>: Generic, combines strong typing with flexibility. For example:

csharp
public ActionResult<Product> GetProduct(int id)
{
    var product = _context.Products.Find(id);
    if (product == null)
        return NotFound();
    return product; // Automatically wrapped in OkObjectResult
}
This is often preferred in Web APIs for clarity and type safety.
