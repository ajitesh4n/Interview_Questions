1. How do Web APIs work?
Web APIs allow different applications to communicate over the Internet by sending and receiving data. The process works as follows:

Client Request: The client (browser, mobile app, or another server) sends a request to the API endpoint.
URL Routing: The server identifies the requested resource and the appropriate handler based on the URL.
Request Processing: The API processes the request, which may involve authentication, validation, or business logic.
Data Handling: The API interacts with databases or other services to retrieve, update, or delete data.
Response Generation: The server prepares a response, usually in JSON or XML format.
Client Response: The response is sent back to the client for display, processing, or further actions.

What is RESTful API?
A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is an architectural style for designing networked applications.

Uses Standard HTTP Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to perform actions.
Stateless: Each request from the client contains all information needed to process it.
Resource-Based: Interacts with resources identified by URLs.
Uniform Interface: Provides a consistent way to access and manipulate resources across applications.
4. What is the difference between SOAP and RESTful APIs?
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)	RESTful API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface)
Protocol with strict standards	Architectural style using standard HTTP methods
Uses XML for messaging	Typically uses JSON (can also use XML or others)
Rigid and feature-rich (security, ACID compliance)	Simpler and lightweight
Relies on defined operations and endpoints	Uses URLs to represent resources
Common in enterprise applications requiring strict contracts	Widely used for web and mobile applications
